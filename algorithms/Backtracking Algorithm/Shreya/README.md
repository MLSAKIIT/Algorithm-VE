# Backtracking Algorithm

## Introduction

Backtracking is a problem-solving strategy based on an algorithm. It finds the solution by creating a solution step by step, increasing values with time, using recursive calling. It eliminates solutions that do not result in a solution to the problem when the restrictions for solving the problem are met.

## Sudoku Puzzle Solving by Backtracking

A Sudoku being solved by backtracking. Each cell is tested for a valid number, moving "back" when there is a violation, and moving forward again until the puzzle is solved. A Sudoku designed to work against the brute force algorithm.
