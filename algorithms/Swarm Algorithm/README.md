Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is an optimization technique introduced by Kennedy and Eberhart in 1995 [39]. It uses a simple mechanism that mimics swarm behaviour in birds
flocking and fish schooling to guide the particles to search for global optimal solutions.Many swarm optimization algorithms have been introduced since the early 60â€™s, Evolutio-
-nary Programming to the most recent, Grey Wolf Optimization. All of these algorithms have demonstrated their potential to solve many optimization problems. 
This paper provides an in-depth survey of well-known optimization algorithms. Selected algorithms are briefly explained and compared with each other comprehensively through 
experiments conducted using thirty well-known benchmark functions. Their advantages and disadvantages are also discussed. A number of statistical tests are then carried out to 
determine the significant performances. The results indicate the overall advantage of Differential Evolution (DE) and is closely followed by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), 
compared with other considered approaches.
